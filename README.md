# The Wildcats App
## A Mobile Information Portal for Westmount Secondary School
See a video walkthrough of the code for the app [here](https://youtu.be/3LN2LpgE3Xc)

### Notes for HWDSB:
Open Wildcats.xcworkspace instead of Wildcats.xcodeproj

workspace contains both app project and libraries used

*NOTE*: For updating of Google Calendar to work, a Google API Key must be used. It is used in AppDelegate.swift and just needs to be pasted as the value for the constant apiKey.
